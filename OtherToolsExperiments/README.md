# EnergyTools Documentation

In the EnergyTools.pdf document, we have detailed the reasons why we preferred using our energy measurement system to evaluate the DLBench+ processes in the Audal Data Lake. Among the reasons are:

- DLBench+ Processes Overlooked: Our analysis reveals that certain short-duration processes in the operating system are not accounted for by other tools, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach.

- Tool Comprehensiveness: We discuss the limitations of existing tools in terms of the components they consider for energy measurement. Our system, in contrast, provides a more holistic view by including CPU, RAM, network card, and storage device.

- Correlation Between Coreâ€™s Load and Energy Consumption: We explore the relationship between the number of cores utilized and the energy consumption, providing insights into the efficiency of parallel processing in energy usage.
