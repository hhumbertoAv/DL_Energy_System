# Description

This folder contains both the raw energy measurement results from our experiments and a file where we averaged these values. For result interpretation, we used a quadratic scale to reduce scale differences and highlight certain outcomes, such as the disparity between CPU and network consumption in metadata processing.

Furthermore, the average results file includes extra information on metadata processing obtained at the end of each experiment. This encompasses, for instance, the count of Neo4J nodes and their related relationships and their disk space usage. This data provides additional context for future analysis. To complement this, we have also documented the average CPU temperature during each experiment to cross-reference with its energy consumption, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
